Additional Use Grant:

You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided Your use does not
include offering the Licensed Work to third parties on a hosted or embedded
basis in order to compete with Melusina Foundation's paid version(s) of the
Licensed Work. For purposes of this license:

A "competitive offering" is a Product that is offered to third parties on a
paid basis, including through paid support arrangements, that significantly
overlaps with the capabilities of Melusina Foundation's paid version(s) of
the Licensed Work. If Your Product is not a competitive offering when You
first make it generally available, it will not become a competitive offering
later due to Melusina Foundation releasing a new version of the Licensed Work
with additional capabilities. In addition, Products that are not provided on
a paid basis are not competitive.

"Product" means software that is offered to end users to manage in their own
environments or offered as a service on a hosted basis.

"Embedded" means including the source code or executable code from the
Licensed Work in a competitive offering. "Embedded" also means packaging the
competitive offering in such a way that the Licensed Work must be accessed or
downloaded for the competitive offering to operate.

Hosting or using the Licensed Work(s) for internal purposes within an
organization is not considered a competitive offering. Melusina Foundation
considers your organization to include all of your affiliates under common
control.

The Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative
works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work. The
Licensor may make an Additional Use Grant, above, permitting limited
production use.

If your use of the Licensed Work does not comply with the requirements
currently in effect as described in this License, you must purchase a
commercial license from the Licensor, its affiliated entities, or authorized
resellers, or you must refrain from using the Licensed Work.

of the Licensed Work, are subject to this License.

You must conspicuously display this License on each original or modified copy
of the Licensed Work. If you receive the Licensed Work in original or
modified form from a third party, the terms and conditions set forth in this
License apply to your use of that work.

Any use of the Licensed Work in violation of this License will automatically
terminate your rights under this License for the current and all other
versions of the Licensed Work.

This License does not grant you any right in any trademark or logo of
Licensor or its affiliates.
